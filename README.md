# Skewed-Beta-Analyzer-
Skewed Beta analyzes the directional tendencies in conjunction to total market index. 
Some stocks go up less than the index when it goes up, but fall much harder when the index falls.
This is an example of a negatively skewed beta. This code attempts to find positively skewed and 
negatively skewed beta in order to build a long-short strategy. 
The assumption here is that this behavior is autoregressive, and past behavior is indicative of similar behavior in the future.
